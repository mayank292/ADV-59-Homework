        <p>My Hobby Is To Play Cricket Because Cricket can be played for competition or for fun. Cricket is a good sport for developing overall fitness, stamina and hand–eye coordination. Cricket uses a hard ball, so protective gear should be worn to avoid injury.Cricket has been an established team sport for hundreds of years and is one of the most popular sports in the
            world. It originated in England and is now very popular in countries such as India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Australia,
            the West Indies and South Africa.Competitive cricket is essentially a bat and ball sport. It is played by two teams on an oval and involves batting,
            fielding and bowling. There are 11 players a side and a game can last anywhere from several hours to several
            days.</p>

        <h1>My Favourite Team</h1>
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I will take the liberty of considering all the teams that I have witnessed for the last 2 decades of watching International Cricket.

            For obvious reasons, the Indian Cricket team would always be my favorite, be it at any given time. Call it patriotism if you may, but it is nearly impossible to not root for your nation when watching any given sport. Therefore, I will exclude the Indian Cricket Team.

            Having said that, my favorite Cricket Team would be South Africa. Not the current team though! The one which I grew up watching. The 2006–2007 South African Team. Captained by the young Left handed batsman, Graeme Smith; this team was loved by everyone including me.

            Graeme Smith, Jacques Kallis, Mark Boucher, AB de Villiers, Herschelle Gibbs, Andrew Hall, Justin Kemp, Makhaya Ntini, Shaun Pollock</p>
